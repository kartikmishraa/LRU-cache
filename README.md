# Introduction

LRU cache is a data structure that is used to store a limited number of items with the goal of improving performance by reducing the number of expensive operations needed to retrieve data. It works on the principle that the items that have been used recently are more likely to be used again, while the items that have not been used recently are less likely to be used again. LRU cache is commonly used in applications where there is a high frequency of reads and a low frequency of writes.

# How LRU Cache works

The LRU cache is implemented using a combination of hash tables and doubly linked lists. Each node in the linked list represents an item in the cache, and the hash table maps the keys to the corresponding nodes in the list. When an item is accessed, it is moved to the front of the list, and when the cache is full, the item at the end of the list (i.e., the least recently used item) is removed.

## Advantages of LRU Cache

- Improves performance by reducing the number of expensive operations needed to retrieve data.
- Reduces the need for frequent access to external storage or databases.
- Can be implemented efficiently using hash tables and linked lists.
- Suitable for applications with a high frequency of reads and a low frequency of writes.

## Disadvantages of LRU Cache

- Can be less efficient for applications with a high frequency of writes or frequent changes to the data.
- Limited by the size of the cache, which can result in the eviction of important items.
- Implementation can be complex, especially for more complex algorithms like "frequency-based" or "hybrid" algorithms.

# Conclusion

LRU cache is a simple and effective way to improve performance in data-intensive applications. By keeping track of recently accessed items and removing the least recently used ones when the cache is full, LRU cache can reduce the number of expensive operations needed to retrieve data and improve application performance.

# LRU Cache

This is a Python-based implementation of LRU Cache, a data structure used to store a limited number of items and improve performance by reducing the number of costly operations needed to retrieve data.

# Requirements

This project requires Python 3.7 or later.

# Usage

To use the LRU Cache, import the LRUCache class from the lru*cache module:
/\_Now add example*/

> The LRUCache class has two methods:

> - put(key, value): Adds an item to the cache with the given key and value. If the cache is full, the least recently used item is removed.
> - get(key): Retrieves the value of the item with the given key from the cache. If the item is not in the cache, None is returned.
